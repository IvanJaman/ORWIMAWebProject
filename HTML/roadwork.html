                <p>Roadwork centers on a man named Barton George Dawes, and takes place in the early-1970s. 
                    Barton is a man on the edge after the death of his young son due to cancer, and is pushed over it by a 
                    highway construction project that will soon lead to the destruction of both his workplace and the neighborhood 
                    he lives in. While Barton is offered money to leave and the possibility of retaining his job at a new facility, 
                    he instead decides to take up arms and defend his property by any means necessary.</p></div>
