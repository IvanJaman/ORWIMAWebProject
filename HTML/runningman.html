                <p>The Running Man is almost an extension of The Long Walk. The story focuses on Ben Richards, a contestant on a 
                    dystopian game show of the same name in which players are chased by "Hunters" and killed if caught. Most of the 
                    details beyond that are different in the book though, as this Ben is simply unable to find work and desperate for 
                    money to support his family, not a framed criminal like Arnold. The Network is still evil though, and Ben still 
                    ends up trying to bring them down.</p></div>
