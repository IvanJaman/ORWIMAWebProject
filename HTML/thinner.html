                <p>Thinner focuses on Billy Halleck, a lawyer who accidentally hits and kills a gypsy woman with his car, 
                    then uses his connections to escape the deserved consequences. The woman's father places a curse on Billy 
                    in retaliation, causing him to lose weight at an uncontrollably dangerous rate. Billy starts off overweight, 
                    so isn't mad at first, but before long, he's worried he's going to keep losing weight until he dies.</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h3>
                <p>Billy Halleck is a successful, arrogant lawyer known for his chronic obesity and sleazy manner. While driving across town he is distracted by his wife Heidi giving him a handjob and runs over an elderly Romani woman, killing her. Billy exploits his connections with the local police and courts to avoid punishment. The woman's father, Taduz Lemke, exacts vengeance by cursing Billy outside the courthouse — using the word "thinner" — and Billy begins to lose weight rapidly regardless of how much he eats. Worried and suspecting cancer, Billy consults a series of doctors, but they are unable to determine the cause of his weight loss. Later, Billy discovers that the judge who cleared him of manslaughter charges has been disfigured by hideous scales growing on his skin, while the policeman who committed perjury on Billy's behalf is now stricken with uncontrollable acne. Both men eventually commit suicide out of shame for their malformed appearances.</p>

                <p>With the help of Richie "The Hammer" Ginelli, a former client with ties to organized crime, and information provided by private detectives, a now-emaciated Billy tracks the Romani band north along the seacoast of New England to Maine. He confronts Lemke at their camp and tries to persuade him to lift the curse but Lemke refuses, insisting that since Billy would not accept responsibility for killing his daughter, he must be judged in the way of Lemke's people. The Romani inhabitants throw Billy out of their camp, though not before Lemke's great-granddaughter Gina shoots him through the hand with a ball bearing fired from a slingshot.</p>
                    
                <p>Billy calls for help from Richie, who sends a mob doctor to treat Billy's hand and then threatens the Romani with violence until Lemke agrees to meet with Billy. Lemke brings a strawberry pie with him and adds blood from Billy's wounded hand to it. He explains that for the curse to be lifted, Billy must pass it to someone else by getting them to eat the pie; however, the old man implores Billy to eat it himself so that he may die with dignity. After finding Richie's severed hand in his car, Billy returns home intending to feed the pie to Heidi as he blames her for his predicament. He falls asleep, and when he wakes, he is horrified to find that both Heidi and his beloved daughter Linda are now cursed. Without hesitation, he eats the rest of the pie.</p>
