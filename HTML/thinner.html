                <p>Thinner focuses on Billy Halleck, a lawyer who accidentally hits and kills a gypsy woman with his car, 
                    then uses his connections to escape the deserved consequences. The woman's father places a curse on Billy 
                    in retaliation, causing him to lose weight at an uncontrollably dangerous rate. Billy starts off overweight, 
                    so isn't mad at first, but before long, he's worried he's going to keep losing weight until he dies.</p></div>
