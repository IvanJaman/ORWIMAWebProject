            <div class="description"><p>The Rage is a psychological thriller novel that focuses on a high school senior who's prone to 
                violent outbursts named Charlie Decker. After one such instance leads to his expulsion, Charlie gets a gun and takes one 
                of his classes hostage, shooting teachers along the way. In the years since its publication, multiple actual school 
                shooters appeared to be inspired by Rage, leading Bachman himself to request the book be taken out of print, where it's 
                remained since the late-1990s.</p></div>
