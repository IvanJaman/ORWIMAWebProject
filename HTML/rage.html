                <p>Rage is a psychological thriller novel that focuses on a high school senior who's prone to 
                violent outbursts named Charlie Decker. After one such instance leads to his expulsion, Charlie gets a gun and takes one 
                of his classes hostage, shooting teachers along the way. In the years since its publication, multiple actual school 
                shooters appeared to be inspired by Rage, leading Bachman himself to request the book be taken out of print.</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Summary</h3>
                <p>Charlie Decker, a Maine high school senior, is called to a meeting with his principal about the cause of his 
                    suspension - an incident in which he struck his chemistry teacher with a pipe wrench, leading to the 
                    teacher's hospitalization. Charlie subjects the principal to a series of insulting remarks, and is expelled.</p>
                <p>Storming out of the office, Charlie retrieves a pistol from his locker, then sets the contents of his 
                    locker on fire. Returning to his classroom, he fatally shoots his algebra teacher, Miss Jean Underwood. 
                    The fire triggers an alarm, but Charlie forces his classmates to stay in the room, killing a history 
                    teacher, Mr. Peter Vance, when he attempts to enter. As the school evacuates, the police and media arrive.</p>
                <p>Over the following four hours, Charlie toys with the authority figures' attempt at negotiation, including 
                    the principal, the school psychologist, and the local police chief. Charlie gives them certain commands, 
                    threatening to kill students if they do not comply. Charlie admits to his hostages that he does not know 
                    what has compelled him to commit his deeds, believing he will regret them when the standoff is over. As 
                    his fellow students start identifying with Charlie, he unwittingly turns the class into an impromptu 
                    psychotherapy group, causing the participants to semi-voluntarily tell embarrassing secrets regarding 
                    themselves and each other.</p>
                <p>Interspersed throughout are flashbacks to Charlie's troubled childhood, particularly his tumultuous 
                    relationship with his abusive father Carl. As the standoff proceeds, a police sniper attempts to shoot 
                    Charlie through the heart. The attempt is foiled by the combination lock inside the breast pocket of 
                    Charlie's shirt.</p>
                <p>Charlie finally realizes that only one student is really being held against his will: "Big Man On Campus" 
                    Ted Jones, who is harboring his own secrets. Ted also realizes this and attempts to escape the classroom, 
                    but the other students brutally assault him. Charlie eventually releases the students except for Ted, who 
                    is in a catatonic state. When the police chief enters the classroom, the now-unarmed Charlie feigns shooting, 
                    causing the chief to shoot Charlie. Later, Charlie, having survived the gunshot, is declared insane and 
                    committed to a psychiatric hospital in Augusta, Maine.</p>
                <p>The final chapters contain an inter-office memo concerning Ted's treatment and prognosis at the hospital 
                    where he is now a patient, and a letter from one of Charlie's friends describing developments in the 
                    students' lives during the months following this incident. The story ends with Charlie addressing the 
                    reader: "That's the end. I have to turn off the light now. Good night."</p>
