            <div class="biography">
                <p>Richard Bachman (1942–1985) was a reclusive and enigmatic American author best known for his dark 
                    and gritty novels that explored the darker corners of the human psyche. Born in a small town in 
                    New Hampshire, Bachman grew up on a struggling dairy farm, where he developed a keen sense of the 
                    rural isolation and quiet desperation that would later permeate his works.</p>

                <p>After graduating high school, Bachman briefly attended a community college, studying agricultural 
                    management, before dropping out to pursue a series of odd jobs, including a stint as a gravedigger 
                    and a caretaker at an abandoned textile mill. These experiences, combined with his fascination for 
                    the macabre and the human condition, deeply influenced his writing style.</p>
                    
                <p>Bachman published his first novel, Rage, in 1977 under the shadow of anonymity. His works, often 
                    characterized by their bleak settings, flawed characters, and relentless pacing, gained a small 
                    but devoted following. Titles like The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man cemented his 
                    reputation as a master of gritty, speculative fiction. Despite this, Bachman largely avoided the 
                    public eye, shunning interviews and declining to attend book signings. He lived for many years in 
                    a remote farmhouse with his wife, Claudia, and their beloved dog, Daisy. When asked about his 
                    reclusive lifestyle, he reportedly quipped, “The quiet lets me hear the stories better.”</p>

                <p>Tragically, Bachman passed away in 1985 from complications related to cancer, cutting short a promising 
                    literary career. Though his bibliography remains relatively small, his works have continued to resonate 
                    with readers, who admire his unflinching portrayal of humanity’s struggles and resilience. Today, 
                    Richard Bachman is remembered as a writer who fearlessly explored the shadowy depths of the human 
                    experience, leaving behind a legacy of gritty, thought-provoking fiction.</p>
