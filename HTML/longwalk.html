                <p>The Long Walk is set in a future dystopia where one hundred teenage boys compete in a walking contest. 
                    The winner gets anything they desire, but the losers end up receiving a much worse fate. 
                    Any competitor who drops below a speed of four miles an hour gets a warning, and after three warnings, 
                    they get shot. Trying to leave the walk also earns death.</p></div>
