                <p>Released poshumously after Bachman's untimely death in 1984, The Regulators was written years earlier and was discovered
                    by Bachman's wife, Claudia Inez Bachman, in the attic. The Regulators is a chilling tale set on Poplar Street, where reality 
                    begins to unravel. Residents transform into characters from a violent, Western-inspired nightmare, controlled by a
                    mysterious force called Tak. As chaos spreads, young Seth struggles to uncover the truth behind Tak's influence. 
                    With supernatural forces threatening their lives, the neighbors must confront a terrifying battle for survival in 
                    this intense, gripping thriller.
